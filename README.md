# PCR_Pipeline_V1

Can determine the Tm of a given gene and primers under various salt conditions

Goal:
The main goal of the pipeline is to quicken and simplyfy the PCR optimization process. Currently, optimizing PCR can take up a significant amount of a researcher's time. The time taken may be from a few days to a few months. The automating part of that process can provide a useful experimental starting point which will speed up many research projects.
